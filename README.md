# 💻 Codeforces Repository — My Competitive Programming Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal Codeforces repository!  
This repo is my **digital notebook in the cloud** where I upload all my **solutions from contests, CP31 sheet problems**, and other **practice sets**.  

---

## 🧩 What's Inside
- 📝 **Contest Solutions:** My submissions from Codeforces contests — clean, optimized, and well-commented.  
- 📘 **CP31 Sheet:** Solving problems from the CP31 sheet, topic by topic.  
- 🌟 **Important Problems:** I mark tricky or must-revise problems using fun **emojis** so they’re easy to spot later!  
- ⚡ **Learning Notes:** Sometimes I drop small insights or tricks I learned from each problem.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
I made this repo to:
- Keep my CP progress organized and accessible anywhere 🌍  
- Track my improvement over time 📈  
- Build a quick reference for revision before contests 🏆

## 🛠️ Tech & Setup
Written mostly in **C++ (GNU G++)** using standard template macros for faster coding.  
All code runs on **Codeforces**, but many problems also fit into **AtCoder**, **CodeChef**, or **LeetCode** style.
